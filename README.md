Description: We all pledge to make changes for the better everytime a new year rolls around. NYR allows users to post and share their own New Years resolutions, with the hopes of inspiring others to better themselves as well. Users are allowed and encouraged to post updates to their resolutions, notifying themselves and others on their progress. The updates feature has a dual functionality, which allows other users to leave comments, questions, and words of encouragement to help the author reach their goal!
